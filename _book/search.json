The model identifies patterns in the training data and generalizes these patterns to new, unseen data.\nML can be thought of as:\n\nPredictive modeling – learning a function that maps inputs (features) to outputs (targets).\nAutomated decision-making – systems that improve their performance over time without explicit reprogramming.",

    "text": "2.2 Major Types of Machine Learning\nMachine learning is commonly categorized into several types based on the nature of the task and availability of labeled data.\n\n2.2.1 1. Supervised Learning\n\nUses labeled data, meaning that each training example has an input and a known output.\nThe goal is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs accurately.\nTypical tasks:\n\nRegression: Predict a continuous variable (e.g., house prices).\nClassification: Predict a categorical variable (e.g., spam vs. non-spam email).\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 2. Unsupervised Learning\n\nWorks with unlabeled data, where the output is unknown.\nThe goal is to discover patterns or structure in the data.\nTypical tasks:\n\nClustering: Group similar observations together (e.g., customer segmentation).\nDimensionality reduction: Reduce the number of features while retaining important information (e.g., PCA).\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 3. Semi-Supervised Learning\n\nCombines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.\nUseful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 4. Reinforcement Learning\n\nFocuses on learning through trial and error.\nAn agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.\nExamples: Robotics, game AI, recommendation systems.",
